Heart Disease Clustering Analysis
This project performs clustering analysis on the Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), implementation of clustering algorithms, and evaluation of clustering performance.

Steps
Data Loading: Load the dataset from the UCI repository.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize and understand the data.
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and scale features.
Clustering Algorithms: Apply K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
Dimensionality Reduction: Use PCA and t-SNE for visualization.
Evaluation: Assess clustering performance using Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.
Requirements
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
Usage
Run the notebook sequentially to perform the analysis and view the results.
